# Alert Rules Reference

Rules are evaluated per-transaction for each watched contract.
Multiple rules can match the same transaction — each fires an independent webhook call.
A rule evaluation error is logged as a warning and skipped; it never stops the engine.

## Rule types

### `AnyTransaction`
Matches every transaction that appears in the contract's Horizon history.

**Use case:** full audit trail, low-volume contracts.

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type = "AnyTransaction"
```

### `TransactionFailed`
Matches transactions where `successful = false`.

**Use case:** detect reverted Soroban invocations or fee-bump failures.

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type = "TransactionFailed"
```

### `LargeTransfer`

| Field           | Type | Required | Description                        |
|-----------------|------|----------|------------------------------------|
| `threshold_xlm` | u64  | yes      | Minimum transfer amount in XLM (> 0) |

Matches when the payment amount (extracted from Horizon operations) is ≥ `threshold_xlm` XLM.
The `amount_xlm` field in the webhook payload contains the actual transferred amount.

**Note:** Amount is extracted from `payment` operation records. Soroban token transfers
that do not produce a native `payment` operation will not populate `amount_xlm`.

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type          = "LargeTransfer"
threshold_xlm = 10000
```

### `FunctionCalled`

| Field           | Type   | Required | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `function_name` | string | yes      | Exact function name (case-sensitive) |

Matches when the Soroban `invoke_host_function` operation calls exactly `function_name`.

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type          = "FunctionCalled"
function_name = "withdraw"
```

### `AdminFunctionCalled`

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                              |
|------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `function_names` | [string] | yes      | Non-empty list of function names to watch |

Matches when the invoked function is any entry in `function_names`.
Equivalent to multiple `FunctionCalled` rules but produces a single
`AdminFunctionCalled([...])` label in the alert.

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type           = "AdminFunctionCalled"
function_names = ["set_admin", "upgrade", "initialize"]
```

### `HighFee`

| Field                | Type | Required | Description                           |
|----------------------|------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `threshold_stroops`  | u64  | yes      | Fee threshold in stroops (> 0)        |

Matches when the transaction's total fee exceeds `threshold_stroops`.
The `fee_charged` field in the webhook payload contains the actual fee paid in stroops.

**Note:** Stroops are the smallest unit of XLM (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops).

```toml
[[contracts.rules]]
type               = "HighFee"
threshold_stroops  = 100000
```

## Evaluation order

Rules are evaluated in the order they appear in the config file.
All matching rules fire; there is no short-circuit.

## Webhook payload fields

| Field              | Type        | Always present | Description                              |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `label`            | string      | yes            | Contract label from config               |
| `contract_id`      | string      | yes            | Stellar C-address                        |
| `network`          | string      | yes            | `mainnet` / `testnet` / `futurenet`      |
| `rule_triggered`   | string      | yes            | Human-readable rule description          |
| `transaction_hash` | string      | yes            | Stellar transaction hash                 |
| `function_name`    | string/null | no             | Soroban function name if available       |
| `amount_xlm`       | u64/null    | no             | Transfer amount in XLM if available      |
| `timestamp`        | i64         | yes            | Unix timestamp (seconds) of transaction  |
| `horizon_link`     | string      | yes            | Direct link to transaction on Horizon    |

## Adding a new rule type

1. Add a variant to `AlertRule` in `crates/config/src/lib.rs`
2. Add field validation in `AlertRule::validate()` in the same file
3. Add the match arm in `eval_rule()` in `crates/rules/src/lib.rs`
4. Add the label string in `rule_label()` in the same file
5. Add unit tests in `crates/rules/src/lib.rs`
6. Document it in this file

No other crates need changes.
